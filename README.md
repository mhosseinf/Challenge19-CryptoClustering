# Challenge19-Cryptocurrency Clustering Analysis

## Code Structure

### 1. Data Preprocessing (crypto_clustering.ipynb)
- **Objective:**
  - Prepare cryptocurrency market data for clustering analysis.

- **Steps:**
  1. **Loading Data:**
     - The `pd.read_csv` function from Pandas is utilized to load market data from a CSV file.

  2. **Scaling Data:**
     - The `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn standardizes numerical features, ensuring consistent scaling for clustering algorithms.

  3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
     - The `PCA` class from scikit-learn performs dimensionality reduction, transforming features into a lower-dimensional space (three principal components).

  4. **Creating DataFrames:**
     - Preprocessed data is organized into Pandas DataFrames for further analysis.

### 2. Clustering Analysis (clustering_analysis.ipynb)

#### **Objective:**
- Apply the K-Means algorithm to cluster cryptocurrencies based on price change percentages.

#### **Steps:**
  1. **Elbow Curve Analysis:**
     - Iteratively compute inertia (within-cluster sum of squared distances) for different k values to create an Elbow curve, aiding in determining the optimal number of clusters.

  2. **K-Means Clustering:**
     - The `KMeans` class from scikit-learn is employed for clustering analysis on both the original scaled data and PCA-transformed data.

  3. **Visualization:**
     - Generate visualizations, including scatter plots and Elbow curves, to provide insights into clustering results.

### **Theoretical Background:**

#### **1. K-Means Clustering:**
   - **Method Name:** `KMeans` (from scikit-learn)
   - **Theoretical Background:**
      - K-Means is an unsupervised clustering algorithm minimizing the within-cluster sum of squared distances. It iteratively assigns data points to clusters and updates centroids until convergence.

#### **2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
   - **Method Name:** `PCA` (from scikit-learn)
   - **Theoretical Background:**
      - PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while retaining original variability.

#### **3. StandardScaler:**
   - **Method Name:** `StandardScaler` (from scikit-learn)
   - **Theoretical Background:**
      - StandardScaler ensures zero mean and unit variance for features, preventing dominance of features with larger magnitudes.

### **Summary:**
The provided code demonstrates K-Means clustering on cryptocurrency market data, incorporating key preprocessing steps like scaling and PCA. Theoretical background in K-Means, PCA, and feature scaling is essential for understanding each step. Implementation is done using scikit-learn, a robust library for machine learning and data analysis.
